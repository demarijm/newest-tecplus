## Overview
Annoyed by the hundreds of paper manifests used every day on his construction sites, Livegistics founder Justin came up with the idea of using software to track materials.

Livegistics approached us early in their development, having just raised funds a year prior. They had a clear vision of what they wanted to build, but needed help with the technical implementation. We worked closely with their team to build a robust backend and intuitive frontend that would allow them to scale their business.

Together we built a platform that has helped Livegistics grow to consistent lead generation and an increase in revenue.

  Studio did an amazing job building out our core blockchain infrastructure and
  I’m sure once PlaceboCoin rallies they’ll be able to finish the project.
